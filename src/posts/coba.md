title: Oryzomys gorgasi
description: Oryzomys gorgasi, also known as Gorgas's oryzomys[5] or Gorgas's
  rice rat,[1] is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. First
  collected as a living animal in 1967, it is known from only a few localities,
  including a freshwater swamp in the lowlands of northwestern Colombia and a
  mangrove islet in northwestern Venezuela. It formerly occurred on the island
  of Curaçao off northwestern Venezuela; this extinct population has been
  described as a separate species, Oryzomys curasoae, but does not differ
  morphologically from mainland populations.

*Oryzomys gorgasi* is a medium-sized [oryzomyine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomyini "Oryzomyini")\[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-H701-21) with small ears and large feet,\[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-H702-22) and is similar to the marsh rice rat in general appearance.\[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Sea208-20) The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below.\[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-H702-22) At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other *Oryzomys*, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for [life in the water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiaquatic_tetrapods "List of semiaquatic tetrapods"). The plantar (lower) surface of the [metatarsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus "Metatarsus") is naked. Two of the [pads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw#Common_characteristics "Paw") are very small. [Ungual tufts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungual_tuft "Ungual tuft"), tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. [Interdigital webbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdigital_webbing "Interdigital webbing") is present, but extends along less than half of the first [phalanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone "Phalanx bone").\[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Sea208-20)

In specimens from El Caimito, total length is 220 to 290 mm (8.7 to 11.4 in), averaging 259 mm (10.2 in) (measured in 6 specimens); tail length is 116 to 138 mm (4.6 to 5.4 in), averaging 130 mm (5.1 in) (measured in 8 specimens); hindfoot length is 30 to 32 mm (1.2 to 1.3 in), averaging 31 mm (1.2 in) (measured in 10 specimens); ear length is 15 to 17 mm (0.59 to 0.67 in), averaging 16 mm (0.63 in) (measured in 7 specimens); and [condylo-incisive length](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Condylo-incisive_length&action=edit&redlink=1 "Condylo-incisive length (page does not exist)") (a measure of total skull size) is 26.9 to 31.4 mm (1.06 to 1.24 in), averaging 29.6 mm (1.17 in) (measured in 5 specimens). In the [holotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype "Holotype") from Colombia, an old male, total length is 240 mm (9.4 in); tail length is 125 mm (4.9 in); ear length is 19 mm (0.75 in); and condylo-incisive length is 32.1 mm (1.26 in).\[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Seat1-23) The collector recorded the holotype's hindfoot as being 34 mm (1.3 in) long, but Sánchez and colleagues remeasured it as 33 mm (1.3 in).\[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Sea207-24)

The rostrum (front part of the [skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull "Skull")) is short. The broad [zygomatic plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_plate "Zygomatic plate") develops a prominent notch, but not a spine, on its front end, and its back margin is in front of the first molars. The [interorbital region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interorbital_region "Interorbital region"), located between the eyes, is narrowest towards the front and is flanked by beadings along its margins. The [interparietal bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interparietal_bone "Interparietal bone") is relatively long. The [incisive foramina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisive_foramen "Incisive foramen"), perforations of the [palate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate "Palate") between the [incisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor "Incisor") and the [molars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth) "Molar (tooth)"), are narrow and long and taper towards the end. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the molars, and includes prominent [posterolateral palatal pits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterolateral_palatal_pits "Posterolateral palatal pits") near the third molars, which are excavated into deep [fossae](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fossa "wikt:fossa"). The roof of the [mesopterygoid fossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesopterygoid_fossa&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mesopterygoid fossa (page does not exist)"), the opening behind the palate, is not perforated by [sphenopalatine vacuities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenopalatine_vacuities "Sphenopalatine vacuities"). *O. gorgasi* lacks an [alisphenoid strut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisphenoid_strut "Alisphenoid strut"); in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the [alisphenoid bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alisphenoid_bone&action=edit&redlink=1 "Alisphenoid bone (page does not exist)") separates two openings in the skull, the [masticatory–buccinator foramen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masticatory%E2%80%93buccinator_foramen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Masticatory–buccinator foramen (page does not exist)") and the [foramen ovale accessorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foramen_ovale_accessorium&action=edit&redlink=1 "Foramen ovale accessorium (page does not exist)"). The [squamosal bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamosal_bone "Squamosal bone") lacks a suspensory process that contacts the [tegmen tympani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegmen_tympani "Tegmen tympani"), the roof of the [tympanic cavity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanic_cavity "Tympanic cavity"),\[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-25) a defining character of oryzomyines.\[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-26) The [subsquamosal fenestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsquamosal_fenestra "Subsquamosal fenestra"), an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is almost absent.\[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Sea209-27)

In the [mandible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible "Mandible") (lower jaw), the upper and lower [masseteric ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Masseteric_ridge&action=edit&redlink=1 "Masseteric ridge (page does not exist)") come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a [capsular process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsular_process "Capsular process"), a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are [opisthodont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthodont "Opisthodont"), with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are [brachydont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachydont "Brachydont") (low-crowned) and [bunodont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunodont "Bunodont") (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They are similar to those of the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.\[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-28)

*Oryzomys gorgasi* is distinguished from other *Oryzomys* species by its short rostrum, the form of its incisive foramina, the absence of sphenopalatine vacuities, and the near absence of a subsquamosal fenestra.\[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Sea210-8) Within the species, the Colombian specimen differs from the Venezuelan animals in being larger in some measurements, but having smaller teeth, and in having oddly shaped wear facets of the incisors. The Colombian animal was probably kept in captivity for some time after it was caught, which would explain its large size and odd wear facets.\[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-Sea208-20) There are no substantial differences between mainland *O. gorgasi* and material from Curaçao.\[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzomys_gorgasi#cite_note-VW77-29)
